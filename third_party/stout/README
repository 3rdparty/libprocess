Stout is a header-only C++ library.

No action is needed if you would like to use this library in your
project. Simply add the include folder to your include path during
compilation.

Depending on which headers you'd like to use, you may require the
following third party libraries:

  - Boost
  - Google's glog (this dependency will be removed in the future).
  - Google's protobuf.
  - Google's gmock/gtest.


Building Tests
==============

We'll assume you've got a distribution of gmock and have already built
a static archive called libgmock.a (see gmock's README to learn
how). We'll also assume the Boost and glog headers can be found via
the include paths and libglog.* can be found via the library search
paths. You can then build the tests via:

$ g++ -I${STOUT}/include -I$(GMOCK)/gtest/include -I$(GMOCK)/include \
  ${STOUT}/tests/tests.cpp libgmock.a -lglog -o tests

Note that if you want to test the gzip headers you'll need to define
HAVE_LIBZ and link against libz:

$ g++ -I${STOUT}/include -I$(GMOCK)/gtest/include -I$(GMOCK)/include \
  -DHAVE_LIBZ ${STOUT}/tests/tests.cpp libgmock.a -lglog -lz -o tests
